After trying out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I now settled with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I saw two of my favorite podcasters, *AlexAnarcho* and *Seth for privacy*, use it and wanted to give it a shot.

They both use the **PaperMod** theme, which I really like for its simplicity. Apart from a few minor bugs, I really like the theme. I hope I can fix those in the future.

*Hugo*'s documentation seems far more complete than the one used by *Jekyll*. It is much easier to find and implement new features such as multilingual support.

This is also the first project in which I used *git*, a tool I fell in love with and I wish I would've known earlier. I plan on writing a full post on *git* in the future.
